# Demo js routing

## About

This module illustrates how to use Javascript Router [component](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/components/global-components/) in a module

It provides a demo page which relies on the Router to allow customers search in PS 1.7.8+.
For PrestaShop 1.7.7, it provides an alternative way as router component is not available.
